    Initialize the start and goal nodes, as well as the grid map or occupancy map.
    Set up the discrete motion model, which defines the feasible motion primitives or actions that the robot can take, such as moving forward or turning left or right.
    Define the continuous motion model, which converts the discrete motion primitives into actual trajectories in the continuous space.
    Implement the heuristic function, which estimates the cost-to-go from each node to the goal, using a suitable metric such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.
    Define the collision detection function, which checks whether a given trajectory intersects with any obstacles in the map.
    Set up the open and closed lists for the A* search, which maintain the set of nodes to be explored and the set of nodes that have already been visited, respectively.
    Initialize the open list with the start node and its estimated cost-to-go.
    While the open list is not empty, do the following:
    a. Pop the node with the lowest estimated cost-to-go from the open list.
    b. If the node is the goal node, return the optimal path.
    c. Generate the successors of the node by applying the feasible motion primitives and converting them into trajectories using the continuous motion model.
    d. For each successor, compute its cost-to-come by adding the cost of the motion primitive to the cost of the parent node, and compute its estimated cost-to-go using the heuristic function.
    e. If the successor is not in the closed list or its new cost-to-come is lower than its previous cost-to-come, update its values and add it to the open list.
    If the goal node is not reached, return failure or a suboptimal path.
